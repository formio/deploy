 - Kubernetes (coming soon)

## Requirements
To run this tool, you'll need NodeJS v16 or higher.

```
npm install -g @formio/deploy
```

## Usage
You can now use this CLI to create deployment packages.

```
formio-deploy package --license=YOURLICENSE
```

This will then create a series of deployments within a "deployments" folder that you can use to deploy Form.io Enterprise within your environment.

### Commands
The following commands are supported.

#### package

```sh
âžœ  ~ formio-deploy package --help
Usage: formio-deploy package|p [options] [path]

Create a new deployment package.

##### Example
The following will create a new multi-container deployment package for AWS, with version 7.3.0 Server Version and 3.3.1 PDF Server Version.

```
formio-deploy package compose/aws/multicontainer.zip --license=YOURLICENSE --version=7.3.0 --pdf-version=3.3.1
```

Once this is done, it will generate a new ZIP file within the deployments folder for ```compose/aws/multicontainer.zip``` as well as place the deployment in the ```deployments/current``` folder.  You can now use the ZIP file to deploy to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

##### Local Example
You can also use this command to create a local deployment on your local machine by first typing the following.

```
formio-deploy package compose/multicontainer.zip --license=YOURLICENSE --version=7.3.0 --pdf-version=3.3.1
```

and then type the following to run.

```
docker-compose -f ~/deployments/current/docker-compose.yml up
```
